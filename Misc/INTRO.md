## üìö About the Project

This project aims to generate synthetic images that closely resemble real astronomical data. The model employed is a Diffusion model, trained on a dataset of astronomical images, and evaluated using industry-standard metrics such as Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID).

### Features

- **Image Generation**: Generate high-quality synthetic images.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate generated images using IS and FID scores.
- **Visualization**: Visualize and analyze both generated and original images.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. **Train the Model**:
    - WIP
    ```

2. **Generate Images**:
    - Generate synthetic images using the trained model:
    WIP
    ```

3. **Evaluate Generated Images**:
    - Calculate IS and FID scores to evaluate the quality of the generated images:
    ```WIP
    ```

4. **Visualize Images**:
    - Visualize the generated and original images to inspect the quality manually:
    ```WIP
    ```

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

### Inception Score (IS)

- Measures both the quality and diversity of the generated images. A higher score indicates better quality and diversity.

### Frechet Inception Distance (FID)

- Measures the similarity between the distribution of real and generated images. A lower score indicates a better match between the two distributions.
